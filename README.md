# DEADMATH
Github Repo for the DEADMATH Series
I'm introducing DEADMATH later this year.
(Will be continuing TIBR towards the very end of the year around November - December 2022)


DeadMath BASIC is a Text-Based 2D Version of Dead By Daylight
If you are unfamiliar with the game I would recommend researching it, Or check out DEADMATH's Wiki hosted on my Repl.it website
This is the BASIC version of the game which is Text Based only, Separate versions such as ICE, C, ASM (See 1) Will contain Sprites and an actual colorized 2D environment

DISCLAIMER: I am no way involved with BHVR. DEADMATH Is a Dead By Daylight Remake on another platform that has very different game aspects

I have one of my friends helping me with this project and they go by @wavejumper3
They will be responsible for the monochrome versions of the game, which have smaller screens, some game elements will have to be removed/moved.
